# QUIZ APP (2013/2014)

Quite old __the npm dependencies _(cough cough bower)_ say it all__.

Not for reuse. Just cataloging here, but incase you want to build this.

## Components

- AngularJS
- Angular UI Router
- Restangular _Yes seriously_
- SASS / SCSS
- Bootstrap
- Gulp

## Getting Started

- Ensure gulp is installed globally _npm i -g gulp_ (PS gulp 3.*)
- clone this repo _https://github.com/casoetan/imprompt_quiz.git_
- cd into your cloned repo _cd ./imprompt_quiz_
- install dependencies
    - _npm install_
    - _bower install_
- run the app in watch mode _gulp serve_ (PS some bugs, but it should still build and open a browser)


### PS
Quite old
